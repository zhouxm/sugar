spark.driver.maxResultSize,1g,"Limit of total size of serialized results of all partitions for each Spark action (e.g. collect) in bytes. Should be at least 1M, or 0 for unlimited. Jobs will be aborted if the total size is above this limit. Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from out-of-memory errors.",1
spark.driver.memory,1g,"Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where SparkContext is initialized, in MiB unless otherwise specified (e.g. 1g, 2g). 
Note: In client mode, this config must not be set through the SparkConf directly in your application, because the driver JVM has already started at that point. Instead, please set this through the --driver-memory command line option or in your default properties file.",1
spark.driver.memoryOverhead,"driverMemory * 0.10, with minimum of 384","The amount of off-heap memory to be allocated per driver in cluster mode, in MiB unless otherwise specified. This is memory that accounts for things like VM overheads, interned strings, other native overheads, etc. This tends to grow with the container size (typically 6-10%). This option is currently supported on YARN and Kubernetes.",1

spark.extraListeners,(none),"A comma-separated list of classes that implement SparkListener; when initializing SparkContext, instances of these classes will be created and registered with Spark's listener bus.

spark.local.dir,/tmp,"Directory to use for ""scratch"" space in Spark, including map output files and RDDs that get stored on disk. This should be on a fast, local disk in your system. It can also be a comma-separated list of multiple directories on different disks.
